# apprentice-progression-pipeline-health
This project aims to create a dashboard that empowers coaches and program managers at EdTech firms to identify apprentices at risk of stagnation, dropout, or underperformance. By surfacing engagement and progression signals in real time, this tool will help optimize coaching interventions, boost completion rates, and strengthen employer outcomes.
